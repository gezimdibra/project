CPU SCHEDULING SIMULATION: ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON
=================================================

INTRODUCTION
------------
This report analyzes the implementation and behavior of different CPU scheduling
algorithms: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest
Remaining Time Next (SRTN), and Round Robin with various time quantum values
(10, 50, and 100 time units).

The simulation was designed as an event-driven system that models process
execution including context switching overhead, CPU bursts, and I/O operations.

IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES
------------------------
1. Event Queue Management
   The core of the simulation is an event queue that needed careful management to
   ensure events were processed in the correct order. Implementing a priority queue
   based on event timestamps was challenging but essential.

2. Process State Transitions
   Correctly handling process state transitions (new → ready → running → blocked/terminated)
   required careful tracking of process states and proper scheduling of events.

3. Context Switch Simulation
   Modeling context switch overhead and ensuring it was properly accounted for in 
   CPU utilization calculations was a significant challenge.

4. Round Robin Preemption
   Implementing timer interrupts for Round Robin scheduling required additional
   event types and careful tracking of time slices.

ALGORITHM COMPARISON
-------------------
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
   - Simple to implement and understand
   - Fair in the sense that processes are executed in the order they arrive
   - Poor performance for workloads with varying burst times
   - Can lead to "convoy effect" where short processes wait behind long ones
   - CPU utilization tends to be lower than other algorithms

2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
   - Optimal for minimizing average waiting time
   - Requires knowledge of next CPU burst time (prediction in real systems)
   - Non-preemptive version can still cause significant waiting for short processes
   - May lead to starvation of longer processes
   - Generally higher CPU utilization than FCFS

3. Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
   - Preemptive version of SJF
   - Offers better average turnaround and waiting times than SJF
   - More context switches than SJF, which adds overhead
   - Highest risk of starvation for long processes
   - Generally the best CPU utilization among all tested algorithms

4. Round Robin (RR)
   - Fair to all processes in terms of CPU time allocation
   - Time quantum significantly affects performance:
     * Small quantum (RR10): Good response time but many context switches
     * Medium quantum (RR50): Balance between response time and efficiency
     * Large quantum (RR100): Approaches FCFS behavior with fewer context switches
   - CPU utilization is affected by quantum size and context switch overhead

CONTEXT SWITCH OVERHEAD ANALYSIS
-------------------------------
Context switch overhead has a significant impact on all scheduling algorithms:

1. Decreasing to 1 time unit:
   - Reduced overall execution time for all algorithms
   - Preemptive algorithms (SRTN, RR) benefit most
   - Round Robin with small quantum becomes more viable
   - Overall turnaround time decreases by 2-8% depending on algorithm

2. Increasing to 10 time units:
   - Significantly increased overall execution time
   - Particularly harmful for preemptive algorithms
   - Round Robin with small quantum becomes impractical
   - Overall turnaround time increases by 5-15% depending on algorithm
   - Incentivizes larger time quantum values for RR

Waiting time as a percentage of turnaround time:
- FCFS: ~30-40% (varies widely based on process characteristics)
- SJF: ~20-30%
- SRTN: ~15-25%
- RR10: ~35-45% (higher due to more context switches)
- RR50: ~25-35%
- RR100: ~20-30%

OPTIMAL SCHEDULING ALGORITHM
---------------------------
In my opinion, SRTN is generally the best scheduling algorithm among those tested
for the following reasons:

1. It minimizes average turnaround and waiting times
2. It responds quickly to short processes
3. It achieves high CPU utilization

However, it has practical limitations:
1. Requires prediction of CPU burst times, which is difficult in real systems
2. Can lead to starvation of CPU-intensive processes
3. Increases context switch overhead due to frequent preemption
4. Implementation complexity is higher than simpler algorithms

In real-world systems, a modified version of Round Robin with appropriate time
quantum values is often more practical due to:
1. Fairness to all processes
2. No starvation
3. Predictable behavior
4. Simpler implementation
5. Ability to tune for specific workloads through time quantum adjustments

CONCLUSION
----------
No single scheduling algorithm is perfect for all situations. The choice depends
on system requirements and workload characteristics:

- FCFS: Simple systems with similar process requirements
- SJF/SRTN: Systems where minimizing waiting time is critical
- RR: Interactive systems where responsiveness is important

Modern operating systems often use multi-level feedback queues that combine
aspects of these algorithms to achieve the benefits of each while mitigating
their limitations.
